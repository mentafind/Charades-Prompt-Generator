# Charades Prompt Generator

Charades Promtp Generator created by Alex Wang.

📖 <u>**Context**</u>
> This project was made for a project for my Communications course. I, alongside my partner, will have to lead the class through a warmup with the class to get everyone's voices ready and to get everyone excited. We chose to lead the class through a game of Charades. 
> 
> In Charades, a volunteer will stand at the front of the class and try to act out a randomly generated prompt without talking, making noises, or using props. The audience has to guess what the volunteer is trying to act out within a certain time-limit.

📝 <u>**Changing the List of Prompts**</u>
> To change the list of prompts, simply edit the prompts.txt file. Each line is a new prompt. Ensure there are no empty lines.
